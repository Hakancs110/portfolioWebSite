                                I have roughly blocked the scene with my initial ideas. Currently, the elements in the scene include:</p>

                                    I also need to determine the camera angle. This way, watching the progression of the scene after the project is completed can be much more enjoyable and informative in spotting any mistakes.

                                The scene being very simple meant that it almost didn't take much of my time. However, I am happy with the initial plan of keeping the scene as simple and concise as possible, so my mood is good. Only towards the end of the project, to fully convey the character's presence in the subway, I added the background columns. Additionally, by adding volumetric cubes to the background, I enhanced the focus on the character and stayed true to the intended context.

                        <p class="pf">I defocused the background using volumetric cubes, and it also added a nice ambiance to the scene. It provided depth to the scene by highlighting spotlights and directing the main focus to the character.</p>
                        <p class="pf">I hadn't added the background columns and upper blocks at the beginning of the project, but I decided to add them later for the scene to be more cohesive. I'm quite satisfied.</p>
                        <p class="pf">Towards the end of the project, one thing that bothered me was the yellow warning lights being in a place where they shouldn't be in the scene. Instead of these dotted yellow columns, long-lined yellow plates serving as a reference for the visually impaired might have been more logical.</p>
                        <p class="pf">The reason for not changing these details after noticing them later is that if I do so, I might deviate from the set project completion date and negatively impact all other project chains. What matters to me is being able to finish a project and then discuss its positives, negatives, truths, and mistakes.</p>

                            <h1>#Grease Pencil Details</h1>
                        </div>
                        <p class="pf">In the environment, there is an animation for Grease Pencil that marks the main scene with an area called a signature frame, an effect on the saxophone, and an animation highlighting the foot movements around the character's feet.</p>
                        <p class="pf">I would love to use Grease Pencil more effectively in my other projects. I believe it contributes significantly to the liveliness and beauty of the scene.</p>
                        <p class="pf">The reason for marking the main scene in a square shape with Grease Pencil was to transfer the character in a small area to the opposite side in this project. My goal was to keep the focus entirely on the character and achieve this with sufficient simplicity. To avoid deviating too much, I added this frame. Ways to improve this in future projects can be thoroughly considered, but for now, this solution seems quite sufficient.</p>

                            After blocking the sections of the bag, I used the remesh feature to smooth and shape the edges. Then, I decimated and rigged it.

                            In the final scene, there was no need to rig the bag. Actually, I initially expected the bag to be more worn. However, I liked it more with a slightly weathered and lively appearance.

                            One thing I noticed while making the bag is that even though UV and texturing processes don't have to be very detailed, they should be considered during modeling; otherwise, it can cause unnecessary effort and time.
