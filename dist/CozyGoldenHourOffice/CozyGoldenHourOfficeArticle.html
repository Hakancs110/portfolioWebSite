                This project was created during a period 
                when I was interested in making isometric 
                rooms. Initially, I had planned to create 
                various room variations and publish them one 
                by one, but later I decided to focus on one and 
                created a detailed work.
            </p>
            <p>
                The project took 2 months to complete.
            </p>
            <p>Software used: Blender</p>
            <p>My plan for this project was actually to be the beginning of a long-term and conceptually similar chain of projects. However, as I progressed in the project, I started to experiment with different things in the 3D space. I decided to set aside making isometric room illustrations for a while, so I decided to make a room and it needed to be a detailed work.
                Before making this decision, I modeled a bunch of different variations of tables and decorations. I'm sharing them below as gifs.
            </p>

            <p>Later on, I continued my way with the combination of the table and decoration that I liked the most.</p>
            <p>The biggest thing I experienced from this project was having an idea in my mind when starting the project, but that this idea hadn't been thought through enough. That's why I changed direction many times throughout the project. And I never knew where to stop. After a while, the project started to look too complex. And the main focus of the project began to fade. So in the next projects after this one, even though I don't have a clear idea of what I want and where to stop, I'm trying to keep it in mind.
            <p>
                I actually took a break from this project with the idea that I had finished it in my mind, but it hadn't been rendered in its final form. Then when I started again, I added many, many elements. I don't know if these contributed positively or negatively to the project. Here are pictures showing the old and new versions.

            </div>
            <p>
                After trying out many, many, and many variations of lighting, I took my final renders. And here's one of the variations of the final version.
