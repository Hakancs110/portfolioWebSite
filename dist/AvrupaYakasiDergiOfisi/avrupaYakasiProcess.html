            <p>This project is a fan project. It is an illustration I created for the "Avrupa Yakası" TV series, which I have been a fan of since childhood.</p>
            <p>Programs I used: Blender</p>
            <p>Project duration: About 3 months</p>
            <p>This project is one of my first completed projects. 
                I started this project suddenly while watching "Avrupa Yakası" and 
                wondering why I don't create something for it. Making the decision 
                was quick, but the actual project took a long time for me. After 
                watching tutorials in Blender, 
                it was valuable for me to try to do it without relying on tutorials.
            </p>
            <h1>References</h1>
            <p>When starting the project, of course, I began by gathering a lot of references. During 
                this time, I can say that I really memorized the office from the series season by season.

            <h1>Modeling</h1>
            <img src="../AvrupaYakasiDergiOfisi/modelingProcess.gif" alt="">
            <p>Of course, since it was a fan art, I couldn't use ready-made assets, so I modeled all the office items strictly following the references.</p>
            <p>Since there are changes in the office according to the seasons, 
                I selected some models based on their respective seasons. For 
                example, wardrobe models or flower models change in all seasons, 
                or desktop computers are replaced by laptops. At this point, I had 
                to make choices for models between seasons.
            </p>
            <p>Actually, objects outside the office, such as cameras and set 
                items, were not originally included in the project, but adding them to 
                fill the scene added a lot to the project in my opinion.</p>
            <h1>Lighting</h1>
            <p>Since my technical knowledge about lighting is 
                insufficient, I have conducted many experiments 
                and I can say that I have chosen the one that is 
                most pleasing to my eye.
            </p>
            <p>Here I am sharing more render with you.</p>
