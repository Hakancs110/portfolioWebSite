                                Firstly, I'm not sure if my technical skills are sufficient for this character because I want to create a fully detailed character, from modeling to animation.

                                It's crucial for me to find an instrumentalist that won't stand out too much.

                                The violin-like instrument at the Incesaz concert I attended yesterday seems like the most logical choice. Moving the bow back and forth and hitting the right chords in a small area seems easier and more doable than a guitar. Also, the sitting posture while playing this instrument seemed the most original to me compared to others.

                                Or maybe placing the music sheet right in front of my hand to obstruct the view might be a better option. Also, this didn't seem like laziness but rather a display of cleverness to me.

                                On November 30, 2023, after a day's break, I decided to make the character a saxophonist. I believe it will be more in sync with the energy of the stage. Plus, adjusting this sound for the project will be easier. I'm not sure how to convey what's in my mind about the guitarist on a guitar, but I can easily convey it humming to the saxophonist. If I can't achieve the sound with artificial intelligence, I'm thinking of collaborating with a saxophonist from Fiverr and basing the entire animation on this sound. These are my current thoughts.

                            When it comes to the character's appearance, creating a different variation and performing the same process is much more efficient and effective than making small changes while wondering which one will look better. It is also educational.
                        </p>
                        <p class="pf">
                            After the initial version of the head, I started creating various head variations. This not only reveals different possibilities but also allows me to notice and correct some mistakes in the model later on.
                        </p>
                        <p class="pf">
                            However, my mistake in creating these variations was deviating too much from the initial model. These significant changes made it challenging to preserve the character's original form. Looking back now, I realize that the initial version aligns more closely with the ideal model I had envisioned for the project.

                            Retopology turned out to be the most challenging part of the project. The face and other body parts didn't pose much difficulty and were technically sound. However, technical limitations were more prominent in the wrinkles of the pants and jacket. This aspect was not topologically accurate and led to a considerable loss of time. I should consider looking into tutorials or courses to improve in this area.

                            I mostly benefited from Pierric Picaut's rigging course, which I watched about half a year ago, for the character rig. I am quite satisfied with the result, as it allows for easy control of the character.

                            I found it more suitable to create facial expressions using shape keys rather than facial rigging. This is because I lack knowledge on how to create a facial rig, and for my current project, having smiling and blowing expressions is sufficient for me. However, for the next project or those beyond it, I am interested in learning how to create facial rigs.

                            In the latest version, I made a few adjustments and added five shape keys: eye blink, blowing, slightly asymmetrical smiling, and grinning.

                            I struggled to achieve a tooth-showing smile. I believe this is due to my limited time and insufficient use of references.

                            For the leather, I used two simple grunge maps; one for roughness variation and the other for height variation. The hair is composed of a solid color only. I noticed that I wasn't achieving the desired roughness setting in Substance Painter, and I resolved this issue within Blender.

                            I kept the character texturing quite simple. Since I wanted to achieve a Hand Painted effect and plan to refine the normal maps with brush strokes, I avoided adding too many details. I only incorporated solid color and roughness variation. I added a few extra details, but their visibility in the final project is minimal.

                            Since I had no knowledge about Grease Pencil rigging, I worked on the Grease Pencil details on the face frame by frame. This was one of the most time-consuming tasks and also quite tedious.

                          <p class="pf">
                            For the other Grease Pencil details on the character's body, I only used the default line art modifier and adjusted the line thickness. In fact, I did this only for the pants. I had plans to do the same for the upper jacket, but due to some technical issues, I couldn't accomplish it. I decided not to add it later.

                            I replaced all the normal maps of the character with those painted using brush strokes. I may not have set the normal map settings technically perfectly. However, it was important for me to try this for the first time and at least not end up with an unsuccessful result.

                            For future projects, if I decide to use this technique again, I want to dedicate more time to this process to achieve better results. I didn't spend too much time on this due to my excitement and the uncertainty of whether it would be effective for the project or not.
